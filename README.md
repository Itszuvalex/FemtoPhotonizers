Energy Conversion Mod
This mod is free for use in any mod pack for any reason, as per the license. 

It is used to convert between RF and OP (FemtoCraft's Power System).

To build, you must first have FemtoCraft's source code. If you are on windows and have access to git from the command line, you can run the batch file. Otherwise, download the 1.7.10 femtocraft source and place it in the libs folder, like this:

.
>libs
>>Femtocraft
>>>src
>>>art
